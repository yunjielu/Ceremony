This Starter Project is both a reference project and a starting point for building games on SpatialOS and Unreal Engine 4.  The project uses the `ThirdPersonExampleMap` and a controllable character `AStarterGameCharacter` on a SpatialOS deployment.

For setup instructions, follow the [Get started](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/get-started/introduction) guide in the GDK for Unreal documentation.

For more information, see the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/).
